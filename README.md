This is the final project of the Foundations Course of The Odin Project. It's a calculator that takes the basic operations and performs them, showing the inputs and results on the screen. I played around with regex a bit and applied a good part of what I learned previously in the course. It was quite a challenge.

I do feel like the code is a bit messy, so I might come back in the future to refactor a portion of it, as well as add keyboard support. Going forward I'll plan things out and think well about what I want first before diving into the coding part.
